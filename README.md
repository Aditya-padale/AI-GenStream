> One app to **chat with images, videos, docs, and even sounds** — because talking to humans is too mainstream.

## 🎯 About

- 🖼️ Ask questions about images or transform them (hello, anime filters!)
- 🎤 Transcribe your audio (we get your voice even when humans don’t)
- 🎥 Analyze videos, whether it's a .mp4 or a spicy YouTube URL
- 🎨 Generate images from your imagination using text prompts
- 📄 Extract and summarize info from PDFs or DOCX files

Powered by **Google Gemini** models via LangChain, this app lets you interact with media like never before.

Because your media deserves to be heard, seen, analyzed, and *transformed* — not just sit silently in your file system like it's still 2005.
